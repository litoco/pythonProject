# pythonProject

This was the my first project in python. It was designed as an university end sem project, on completion of basic python course.
This project included Tkinter library and database connectivity concepts.
It was developed in python 2.7 and now upgraded to python 3.5+ versions.


Because this was my first project I only focussed some of the basic functionality that a restraunt billing system can have.
 My main focus was to make the gui look better. 
It took nearly 2-3 weeks for me to  complete this.

It was an individual project and I was awarded A+ grade points for this project.
